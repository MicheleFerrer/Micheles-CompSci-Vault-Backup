1. Function notation 
2. linear functions
$$
	slope  (m)=rise/run=y2-y1/x2-x1
$$
3. constant slopes only work for linear functions, to find the slope of a parabola (quadratic function) we find the slope of a secant line which is an imaginary line that connects the two points.
$$
4. // point slope form  //  y-y1=m(x-x1) //
5. // slope intercept form// y=mx+b
$$
4. Exponents
	1. rational exponents
		1. have to be comfortable when going from a radical to a rational exponent
	2. negative exponent rule
		1. have to take a positive exponent and rewrite it to a negative exponent just tog et rid of fractions.
	2. greatest common factor with exponents
		1. using quotient rule
	3. domain and range
		1. interval notation 
		2. will use interval notation during curve sketch (by which intervals is the graph increasing or decreasing.)
			2. ()-> not inclusive (open circle on a graph)
			3. []-> inclusive (filled in dot or graph running through)
			4. positive and negative infinity (has to be open bracket)
			5. union U (and/or)
		3. set notation
			1. greater than> less than< etc
$$
			2. {{x|x>4, x eR}
$$
5. composite functions
	1. take the outputs of one function and you substitute it into the input of another function
		1. find f(g(x)) or find (f o g)(x)
			1. what is f(x) and g(x)$$
		 (x^2-4x)^3	
			 **f(x)=x^3 
				 **g( x)=x^2-4x
		$$
1. Find $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ for $Log2x^3$ default function for log is logx
2. $log2x^3$ 
3. $f(x)=log(x)$
4. $g(x)=2x^3$
5. $1/sin2x$ -> $(sin2x)^-1$
	1. default function for sin is sinx
	2. $f(x)=(x)^-1$
	3. $g(x)=sinx$
	4. $h(x)=2x$
